### Game Structure:
- 3 options: rock, paper, scissors
- The user inputs an option, and the computer also randomly inputs an option
- The game is structured in a 'best 2 out of 3' format

### Coding challenge:
- Lvl 1: Create a simple command line python game
- Lvl 2: Create a UI for the game
- Lvl 3: Implement tensorflow object detection motion tracking
- Lvl 4: Implement stretch

### Stretch:
- Zen mode
- Database to record wins and losses per user
- User accounts
- User vs User option, as opposed to User vs Computer
