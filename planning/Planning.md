### Objective:
Create a game of rock paper scissors where a user plays against a computer. 

### Game Structure:
- 3 options: rock, paper, scissors
- The user inputs an option, and the computer also randomly inputs an option
- The game is structured in a 'best 2 out of 3' format

### Coding challenge:

  - [-] Lvl 1.5: Create a UI for the game
- [-] Lvl 2: Refactor code
- [-] Lvl 3: Implement tensorflow object detection motion tracking
- [-] Lvl 4: Implement stretch

### Stretch:
- [-] Zen mode - infinite rounds
- [-] Countdown & random variations in computer 'shoot' time
- [-] Database to record wins and losses per user
- [-] User accounts
- [-] User vs User option, as opposed to User vs Computer

### Page structure:
