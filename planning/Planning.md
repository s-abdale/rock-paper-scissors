# Planning

### Objective:
Create a game of rock paper scissors where a user plays against a computer. 

### Game Structure:
- 3 options: rock, paper, scissors
- The user inputs an option, and the computer also randomly inputs an option
- The game is structured in a 'best 2 out of 3' format

### Coding challenge:
[-] Lvl 1: Create a basic game
[-] Lvl 2: Create a UI for the game
[-] Lvl 3: Implement tensorflow object detection motion tracking
[-] Lvl 4: Implement stretch

### Stretch:
[-] Zen mode - infinite rounds
[-] Countdown & random variations in computer 'shoot' time
[-] Database to record wins and losses per user
[-] User accounts
[-] User vs User option, as opposed to User vs Computer

### Page structure:
[-] Header
[-] Cumulative points -> player vs computer
[-] Moves remaining
[-] Who won the current round 
[-] Each player's status (win, loss, tie)
[-] Buttons for commands
[-] Game over/ round number
[-] Footer
